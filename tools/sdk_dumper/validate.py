"""Regression check for the SDK dumper against layouts verified by hand (engine factories,
IsValid/Execute disassembly and the RE cheatsheet). Run after every game patch:

    python tools/sdk_dumper/validate.py

Exit code 1 if any known field moved in a way the dumper did not reproduce.
Offsets are Windows object offsets (from the start of the object / command).
